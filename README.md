# Soundpack-for-Telegram
Hello, This is SoundPack bot.

I was inspired by stickers and thought it was a good idea to use sets of short sounds instead of images to convey emotions in chat. 
This has already been implemented in some video games, but it hasn't reached messengers yet.

This bot allows users to forward predefined sets of sounds, but its main goal is different. 
It is simply a demonstration of a new feature for Telegram. The SoundPack design may not be very user-friendly, as it is just an example.

A similar feature could be integrated into the application's interface, similar to stickers. 
It is important to differentiate sounds from voice messages, so a new visual representation is required. 
According to this idea, each sound corresponds to its own image.

# How to launch
To host this bot you need to create file named "tgtoken.py" with string variable token = <your token>
